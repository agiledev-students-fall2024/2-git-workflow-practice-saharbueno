## My Thoughts
* While reading this article, it was inspiring to see how software engineering interns were able to work on such influential projects that millions of players around the world see and interact with.
Particularly, I enjoyed reading about Allison Chow's experience and what she worked on. The most interesting piece of work she did in my opinion was working with C++ and Javascript to modify the frontend of TFT (Team Fight Tactics). She built a game mode selection screen for new players and added to a couple components in the TFT and new player hubs. In the article, she showcases the design of the features she worked on which was very cool to me. Another project I found interesting was Chunlok Lo's. He worked on the Riot Client SDK which is responsible for logins, chats, launching the games, and more. It's an extremely important part of Riot's software, so it's cool to see an intern working on something that is vital for Riot and all the players.
