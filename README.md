## My Thoughts
* While reading this article, it was inspiring to see how software engineering interns were able to work on such influential projects that millions of players around the world see and interact with.
Particularly, I enjoyed reading about Allison Chow's experience and what she worked on. The most interesting piece of work she did in my opinion was working with C++ and Javascript to modify the frontend of TFT (Team Fight Tactics). She built a game mode selection screen for new players and added to a couple components in the TFT and new player hubs. In the article, she showcases the design of the features she worked on which was very cool to me. Another project I found interesting was Chunlok Lo's. He worked on the Riot Client SDK which is responsible for logins, chats, launching the games, and more. It's an extremely important part of Riot's software, so it's cool to see an intern working on something that is vital for Riot and all the players. 

## Stella Zhang's Thoughts
* As someone who wants to go into software engineering, seeing the details of these projects by individual software engineering interns was very helpful and inspiring. I enjoyed reading about Allison Chow's work in the LoL Growth team, making adjustments to a number of different parts of the game to improve the player experience.

## Diya Agrawal's Thoughts 
* It’s impressive how interns like Allison Chow and Chunlok Lo have made substantial contributions at Riot Games. Allison’s innovative work on the Team Fight Tactics frontend, including the game mode selection screen, and Chunlok’s development on the Riot Client SDK, which handles essential functions like logins and chats, showcase that interns, while they may not be expected to, can still play an extremely valuable role in a company's service or product.
